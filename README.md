Evolutionary strategies and genetic algorithms for CartPole and HalfCheetah

Implemented evolutionary algorithm and genetic strategy in NumPy for Gym's CartPole environment.  Used Roboschool as an alternative to Mujoco for genetic strategies in HalfCheetah.
Using Maxim Lapan's base code for genetic strategy, added a few new implementations.
* In [cheetah_ga.py], added
